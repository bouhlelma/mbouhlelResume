Mohamed Amine Bouhlel's Resume

Mohamed‑Amine Bouhlel, Ph.D. – Research Engineer

Summary
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics with extensive experience in data science, machine learning, surrogate modeling, optimization and predictive modeling. Adept at algorithm development and software engineering, with advanced proficiency in Python, MATLAB and R as well as C/C++, Fortran and web technologies. Recent work includes designing open‑source modeling toolkits and developing optimization and analysis systems for aerospace and semiconductor industries.

Projects
• Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) – Developed an open‑source Python package that collects surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques and benchmarking functions. The library emphasises derivatives (training, prediction and derivatives with respect to training data) and includes unique models such as kriging by partial‑least‑squares and energy‑minimizing spline interpolation. It provides examples, automatically tested documentation and is distributed under the New BSD licence. (May 2016 – present)

• Webfoil Airfoil Design Tool – Led the development of a web‑based airfoil design tool that doubles as a database of airfoils and an interactive design and optimization tool. The machine‑learning algorithm predicts and optimizes airfoils using a single CPU instead of requiring sixteen CPUs for hours of computation, and improves prediction accuracy through deep‑learning techniques. (2016 – 2019)

• Predictive Modeling Toolkit – Designed and developed an open‑source predictive modeling toolkit and optimization algorithm used for the Webfoil tool.

• Nano‑IR Data Manipulation App – Built a Python application that accelerates failure and detection analysis of Nano‑IR data. The app automatically generates PDF reports and correlates defect spectra with materials databases such as Wiley via KnowItAll software, using Tkinter for the user interface.

• Regression Automation System – Developed a system to automatically run regression tests and check results across more than twenty applications through a unified interface.

• Jarvis Error Parser Service – Implemented a service to log failures from the Jarvis platform into a database and send email notifications every twelve hours with a list of unresolved issues.

• Image Denoiser Model – Created a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras to denoise two‑dimensional images.

Professional Experience
• Software Application Development Engineer – Intel Corporation (Nov 2021 – present, remote). Full‑time role building software solutions for hardware and engineering teams. Developed internal applications including the regression automation system, the Jarvis error parser service, the Nano‑IR data manipulation app and an image denoiser model, and supported data analysis and reporting activities.

• Automation Engineer – Intel (Spectraforce Technologies) (Aug 2021 – Nov 2021). Contract role automating workflows and supporting software deployment.

• Machine‑Learning & Design‑Optimization Postdoctoral Researcher – University of Michigan (Jun 2016 – May 2019). Led development of the Webfoil airfoil design tool, improved aerodynamic prediction accuracy by 2.5 % using deep learning, and created an open‑source Python package for predictive modeling.

• Research & Development Engineer – SNECMA Safran, Paris (Mar 2014 – Sep 2015). Advanced Bayesian modeling for problems with up to one hundred parameters, reducing error by up to 28 %, and built an automated Bayesian optimization framework for designing three‑dimensional turbomachinery blades.

• Computational Software Engineer – AES Ingenierie (Nov 2011 – Apr 2012). Performed studies on fatigue and crack propagation in the Airbus A380 wing box.

• Engineering Intern – INRIA (Mar 2011 – Aug 2011). Developed a 2D Galerkin discontinuous solver for seismic problems using Fortran.

• Engineering Intern – CERFACS (Jun 2010 – Aug 2010). Contributed to the development of the GMRES method for solving Galbrun’s equation.

• Numerical Methods Intern – NACHOS project‑team, Inria (Apr 2011 – Sep 2011). Built a discontinuous Galerkin solver for two‑dimensional seismic problems.

• Iterative Solvers Intern – CERFACS (Jun 2010 – Sep 2011). Conducted comparative studies of the Galbrun equation for acoustics with different parameters and preconditioners.

Education
• Ph.D. in Computational and Applied Mathematics – ISAE‑SUPAERO (2012 – 2016). Collaborated with SNECMA Safran and ONERA Toulouse; advanced Bayesian modeling for high‑dimensional problems and developed automated Bayesian optimization for three‑dimensional turbomachinery blades.
